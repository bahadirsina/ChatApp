# ChatApp

Multiclient chat application is a software that allows multiple users to communicate at the same time. This type of application provides a platform where different users can send and receive text-based messages with each other.
Multiclient chat application is usually built on a server-based architecture. The server is a central point where all users connect and can receive messages sent by users, forward them and forward them to other users. Users can communicate with each other by connecting to this server from various devices (computer, smartphone, tablet, etc.).
In this type of chat application, when a user sends a message, the server uses appropriate protocols to forward that message to other users. Messages are usually delivered in real time, meaning they reach target users as soon as they are sent. Thus, a message written by a user can be quickly seen and replied to by other users.
